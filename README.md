# Final Project
## Project description:
        We will create a web application that will be our weather station,
        we will configure a Rasperry PI simulator device (not a real simulator,
        you can buy some for the fun too) which sends the temperature
        and humidity inside the house into real time to our API in the cloud.
        It is based on Rasberry PI simulator which will give us the 'Fake'
        information on temperature and humidity per hour like it's a real
        plugged-in device.
        And we will display the curve on a graphical interface (web page):
        The project takes place in 3 stages:
        1st part: configure and set up Rasberry PI simulator.
        2 nd part: configure the API and deploy it, which aims to receive data
	and secondly display the data on a web page or cloud address.
	3 rd: Configure the cloud to receive data from the API
