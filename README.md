# Home Weather Station
## Project description:
        We will create a web application that will be our weather station,
        we will use a Rasperry PI simulator device (not a real simulator,
        you can buy some for the fun too) which sends the temperature
        and humidity inside the house into real time to our API in the
	Azure cloud.
	```
        The project takes place in 3 stages:
        1st part: configure and set up Rasberry PI simulator.
        2 nd part: configure the API and deploy it, which aims to receive data
	and secondly display the data on a web page or cloud address.
	3 rd: Configure the cloud to receive data from the API
